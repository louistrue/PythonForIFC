# PythonForIFC

## Overview
PythonForIFC is a collection of Python scripts and applications specifically designed for working with IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) STEP files. These scripts are tailored to facilitate the manipulation, analysis, and processing of IFC files, which are commonly used in BIM (Building Information Modeling) and other CAD applications in the construction industry.

## Features
- **IFC File Handling**: Efficiently read, write, and modify IFC STEP files.
- **Data Extraction**: Extract specific data and metadata from IFC files for analysis.
- **Model Visualization**: Scripts to aid in the visualization of data from IFC models.
- **Automation Tools**: Simplify repetitive tasks in IFC file handling and manipulation.

## Requirements
- **Python**: The scripts are written in Python, requiring Python 3.x.
- **Dependencies**: Necessary Python libraries and frameworks, as specified in the projects.

## Installation
